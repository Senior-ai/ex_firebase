# What's this repository all about?

To showcase how to implement and use Firebase in its latest version.
This project also shows how to use redux. Yes of course in real scenarios there wont be usages of both at the same time(Probably, most of the times).

### Make sure to not get confused!

The repository's main focus is to showcase how to first save at the front end and only then when needed by the user's needs, to save it in the database. In this specific circumstance I've provided 2 ways to handle it, each has its own pros and cons.
In each component and App.js itself, there are 2 versions, in all of them the 1st version I've wrote is marked out.

### Make sure to update firebaseConfig!

to run it locally, please make sure the firebaseConfig has the correct credentials of your web app in Firebase.
